# Project
Github Battles is a fun project I've done as a part of an online course. 
It let me brush up my React knowledge after working with almost only vanilla JS for a few months. 
I learned how to use Github API and write cleaner code for asynchronous requests with ES6 Promises. I focused on making my code modular and reusable.
